SUMMARY:

Initialization:

The ParserFasta class is instantiated with specific parameters 
(w for window size, and p for modulus value) and an output file prefix.
This setup prepares the parser to write to an output file named according to the provided prefix, 
which will contain the parsed results.

Reading and Processing:

The process method employs the read_fasta function to read sequences from a specified FASTA file. 
This method leverages BioPython's SeqIO.parse to load and iterate through sequences in the file efficiently. 
Each sequence retrieved is then processed individually.

Sequence Processing:

Within the process_record method, each sequence undergoes processing where a rolling hash mechanism 
(Mersenne Karp-Rabin) is applied. As the sequence is read character by character, the hash is continuously updated.
When the hash value of the current window (of length w) modulo p equals zero (trigger condition), 
the window is converted into a tuple and recorded in a dictionary that counts the occurrences of 
each unique window, or "phrase".

Finalizing Parsing:

After all characters in a sequence are processed, finalize_parsing manages the final window 
of characters by appending a special end symbol ($) and writing the final hash value to the output file. 
This method ensures that the parsing results are properly recorded, including the last segment of the sequence.

Cleanup:

The close method is called to ensure the output file is properly closed after all parsing 
activities are completed, marking the end of file processing and securing the written data.

Static Methods:

read_fasta: Reads sequences directly from a FASTA file and returns them as a list, 
which simplifies the handling of sequence data.
parse_fasta: Parses a FASTA file and returns a dictionary of sequences indexed by their headers (sequence IDs). 
This method provides quick access to specific sequences, facilitating efficient data manipulation and analysis.
